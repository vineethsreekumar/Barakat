                           The genesis of Barakat dates back to 1976 with our humble beginnings in the trade of fresh vegetables and fruits – a tradition that Barakat has preserved to date. Barakat continues to be the most trusted source for a fascinatingly diverse spectrum of foods - from the mundane to exotic, and from the essentials to the esoteric. In addition to fresh Fruits & Vegetables, Barakat has added more convenience to the portfolio with Cut & Packed Fruits & Vegetables, Freshly Squeezed Juices, Fresh Salads, Healthy Soups, Ice Cream and Ice Pops made with fresh fruits & vegetables. Quality, Freshness and Health is at the heart of every Barakat product and every Barakati lives by that promise.
